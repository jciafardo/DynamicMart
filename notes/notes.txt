STORE APP:
basic store views like homepage viewing products and buying etc

USERS APP:
responsible for managing accounts



Backend To Do:
allow user to change password 
9. After a user logs in whenever I reload the page I get a csrf error this is due to trying to log a user in when they are alreayd logged in
   to fix the above problem I will change the CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW setting in my settings.py since the error is not really a security flaw

13. make sure no inline css is being used
15. make sure to only send email recipts when purhcase is success and only allow acsess to checkout success page if the user acually purhcases items
same with declined checkout

check if product is in stock before allowing user to purchase. Sometimes the item can be in the cart
but it sells out before the user checks out




find out why view/dsjfdslkf shows the mclarin



AUTHENTICATION To Do:
    allow user to login and create account through google


SECURITY TO Do:
    secure stripe api keys
    defend against other attacks


Frontend To Do:
3. make email receipts look nice
